    <p>You're gonna short circuit yourself</p>
    <p>A little short circuit here and there is just robot spice</p>
    <p>wearing red converse the robot king</p>
    <p>not if you keep it liquid in your robot body</p>
    <p>Tbh I think if you were a robot, youd still die if you drank that</p>
    <p>Who said you have to be a robot</p>
    <p>suddenly it feels more okay than if it was a full robot that looks nothing like a humanoid</p>
    <p>is this a world where robots just roam free and you can make frainds with them</p>
    <p>A robot with human tendencies and it randomly can choose to pause u or smthn</p>
    <p>Yes but imagine it's like a little robot that does human things like</p>
    <p>robotics stuff</p>
    <p>like even the ai tech robots</p>
    <p>are robotic</p>
    <p>but I will see these ppl in start ups and it just feels like they are robots</p>
    <p>I asked them about the robot they did</p>
    <p>I think the most scary part about it isn't the advanced technology but how enthusiastic people are about it</p>
    <p>like too much technology I have become nauseous and consumed by it</p>
