  <p>sleep wellüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏èüôÇ‚Äç‚ÜïÔ∏è</p>
  <p>yes I was to sleep as well</p>
  <p>I fell back asleep until just now</p>
  <p>Sleep all day me too i wanna be a cat</p>
  <p>Recently I‚Äôve been falling asleep when doing homework so I haven‚Äôt been putting my night lens in and now I need glasses</p>
  <p>Or I'd toss and turn at night cause I had a miserable day and can't sleep...</p>
  <p>But u need to start prioritising ur sleep cause u need to recover from finals</p>
  <p>Sleep is the most essential item in ur beauty kit</p>
  <p>The reason I cannot sleep is cause im too NERVOUS</p>
  <p>Okay just put ur phone on the other end of ur room and raw dog it...</p>
  <p>Usually I just sleep when my body forces me to</p>
  <p>Okay go sleep</p>
  <p>Go to sleep stop texting</p>
  <p>Bro I fucked up my sleep schedule</p>
  <p>Guys we need a life 360 version of a sleep tracker...</p>
  <p>He see's me when I'm sleeping, but I sleep with one eye open</p>
  <p>sleep deprivation</p>
  <p>Ok but I'm still salty how you guys are able to prioritize sleep like your love depends on it</p>
  <p>But i can't do that unless I'm hella sleep deprived</p>
  <p>biphasic sleep schedule</p>
  <p>Anyway my world is ending and i can't even sleep through it</p>
  <p>we love you for you, whether or not you feel sad...</p>
  <p>What if u let all ur thoughts out, if u can't sleep...</p>
  <p>Process tomorrow, sleep now</p>
  <p>But i need to sleep :(((</p>
  <p>Those sleep reiki videos</p>
  <p>kinda fire to sleep to</p>
  <p>ur so ok! I was asleep LOL</p>
  <p>and i'm always in a state of wanting to sleep forever</p>
  <p>I wanted to sleep blissfully</p>
  <p>we can sleep in a lil and also get the filming done sooner</p>
  <p>i've aligned myself with sleep my fucking life away on the weekends <small>(and doing work ig?)</small></p>
  <p>I can't keep pulling the kinda sleep atrocities I have been</p>
  <p>also i fell asleep and napped for 3.5 hours...</p>
  <p>fixed my sleep schedule this semester</p>
  <p>sleep deprived</p>
  <p>I need to sleep I wake up like 7 am despite going to sleep at 1-2 am</p>
  <p>like when im home i just sleep eat and do work</p>
  <p>I just use it to shut my brain off before I sleep LOL</p>
  <p>maybe I will paint ruin my sleep schedule for that</p>
  <p>sit at their desk all day and night and have awful sleep schedules</p>
  <p>i hope the weekend you sleep 9 million years</p>
  <p>I hope I can sleep during work tmrw</p>
  <p>No but deadass like best sleep of life after bc max stimulation reached</p>
  <p>I slept late last night and now I think it's optimistic...</p>
  <p>I don't like the awful stress it causes me and the sleep schedule that comes with it</p>
  <p>im so sleep deprived and running on caffeine rn</p>
  <p>that's all i'm going to say, hope u get back safe and sleep well</p>
  <p>istg live bug fixing + lack of sleep is making me crash out</p>
  <p>sleep schedule abt to be cooked</p>
