            Like everything, AI has its pros and cons, it can be a great tool 
            if used correctly by the right people
        </p>

        <p class="text2">I think my biggest concern with AI is that it discourages 
            critical thinking. At a conceptual level there’s not really much difference 
            between AI pulling from a database to create an image vs the human brain
             pulling from its knowledge to create an artwork. In regards to industrial 
             design and other fields i think AI can be dangerous if used excessively. 
             Design choices have massive impact on every scale and we can’t just take what an AI says as fact</p>
        
        <p class="text1">
            AI is interesting but needs to be regulated and used cautiously
        </p>
        <p class="text3">
            I think there is a way to utilize AI when considering design. I’ve used a lot of 
            AI to find websites and studies for data when I need it, or to help me make a 
            template for a project statement.Also especially because of the state of AI 
            at the moment, AI doesn’t understand little details that are very important aspects 
            of art and design. Things like proportion and depth or even the aspect of incorporating imperfection.
        </p>

        <p class="text2">it's actually so shocking to see how much AI consumed "normal" people idrk how else to put it</p>
        <p class="text2">it's actually so sad to see how much AI is being used in creation</p>
        <p class="text2">No creative person wants to make that and no average person wants to see an AI generated ad</p>

        <p class="text1">
            WHY DO THEY LOOK AI GENERATED
        </p>

         <p class="text3">bc itll just be filled with ai and bots</p>
        <p class="text3">like i might fucking hate generative ai bc its literally
             stealing from artists and just destroying the culture that we have</p>
        <p class="text3">im using ai so much at work bro most of the time im 
            j sittign there n waiting for ai to finish my work</p>
         <p class="text1">
            the openai ceo guy said his company will kill every software startups and all the kids got scared
        </p>

        <p class="text2">i want to make a ui builder project usign localized ai models</p>
        <p class="text2">basically its an ai canvas that stores and resurface ur ideas as you use/need it</p>

        <p class="text3">Its bc of ai bros</p>
        <p class="text3">like even the ai tech robots</p>
        <p class="text3">Most of the ppl with ai jobs are lame</p>
        <p class="text3">My wirk is having us use Ai in design presentations</p>
        <p class="text3">I also think rn ppl are inventing ai to solve problems that don't exist</p>
